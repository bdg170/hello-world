# hello-world
My project to learn how this works to make life easier.
I am Linux sys admin new to git. //I'm hoping to develop some new skills to help automate traditional admin tasks to deploy across multiple servers so I can spend more time doing other things, and to ensure consistency across hosts.
Here we go!
